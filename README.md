Hi There
This is a Tic Tac Toe Game Using HTML CSS and JavaScript
Upgrading the level of learning by making this game 
It uses simple logic of the game where we have to match the columns, rows or diagonals and when one of them is matched we have a winner.
Html is used to make the structure of the game , Css for adding the desgins in the blocks like when cursor is pointed towards a box it makes a box shadow 
and Javascript is used for the basic logic of game plus adding some music in the game as well like a player makes its turn and clicks on the specific box it makes a noice... and at the end the winner of the game is displayed with a gif of a kitty celeberating.
